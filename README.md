# Server
Console Server
This is a chat server made in Qt using WinSock.

To connect over LAN, set the IP to the IPv4 address by typing ipconfig in cmd.

To connect over Hamachi, set the IP to your Hamachi IP.

To connect over Internet directly, firstly you will require some portforwarding on the set port and then set your IP
equal to the external IP from whatsmyip.com or something similar.
